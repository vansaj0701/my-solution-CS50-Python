## What is Poetry?
Poetry is a form of literary expression that uses rhythmic, often compact language to convey emotions, ideas, or tell stories. Unlike prose, poetry often employs various devices such as meter, rhyme, metaphor, and symbolism to create a heightened aesthetic experience. It can be written in a structured format with specific rules, like sonnets or haikus, or in free verse with no strict guidelines. Poetry allows writers to express complex feelings and abstract concepts, often evoking a deep emotional response from readers or listeners. Through its unique use of language, poetry captures the beauty, struggle, and intricacies of human experience.

| LIKE the touch of rain she was        |
| On a man's flesh and hair and eyes    |
| When the joy of walking thus          |
